Distributed VCS:

  - In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don't
    just check out the latest snapshot of the files they fully mirror
    the repository. Thus if any server dies, and thxese systems were
    collaborating via it, any of the client repositories can be copied
    back up to the server to restore it. Every checkout is really a
    full backup of all the data.

  - Yet another para.

Git Intro:

  - Git is an *open source*, distributed version control system
    designed for speed and efficiency.

  - You can get a Git project using two main approaches. The first
    takes an existing project or directory and imports it into
    Git. The second clones an existing Git repository from another
    server.
