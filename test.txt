= Git Presentation

== Distributed VCS

In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don't
just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the
repository. Thus if any server dies, and these systems were
collaborating via it, any of the client repositories can be copied
back up to the server to restore it. Every checkout is really a full
backup of all the data.

Yet another para.

    designed for speed and efficiency.

  * You can get a Git project using two main approaches. The first
    takes an existing project or directory and imports it into
    Git. The second clones an existing Git repository from another
    server.
